# Glaucoma-Grading-Classification-and-Risk-Prediction-Based-on-Deep-Learning
During 2023-2024,we used a multimodal dataset of glaucoma patients to train to get a model to deal with glaucoma classification, categorisation 和 risk prediction at the same time, which combines both multimodality 和 accomplishes multitasking; 和 ends up with high accuracy.
